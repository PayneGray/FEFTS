# FEFTS
Fire Emblem Fates Text Simulator


Forked from https://github.com/SciresM/FEITS .
Credit to SciresM for the original program. I only localized the names and fixed a few things.
Special thanks to deventio7 for creating the script that renames Fates portraits properly!

Simulates Fire Emblem Fates conversations, allows for the generation of portraits with specific hair colors, and is generally neat.

== Things that still need to be done ==

- See if the font can be used for the generated text instead of the PNG, for higher-resolution images.

- Implement DLC portraits. Portraits, along with FaceData.bin files, are located in FEFTS\Resources\img\Not_Yet_Used\.
