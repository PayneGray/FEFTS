# FEFTS
Fire Emblem Fates Text Simulator


Forked from https://github.com/SciresM/FEITS. Credit to SciresM for the original program. I only localized the names and fixed a few things.

Simulates Fire Emblem Fates conversations, allows for the generation of portraits with specific hair colors, and is generally neat. 


# V1.2.1 Changelog

- Optimized PNGs to save a bit of memory and hopefully boot a bit faster.

- Changed default conversation to something absurd (Selkie/Chrom) to better show the benefits of the program.

- Changed name to "Fire Emblem Fates Text Simulator".

- Localized Reference Guide, and stored locally.

- 


# V1.2 Changelog

-Localized the names to fit the official names Nintendo of America gave the international version of Fire Emblem Fates.

-Added Fire Emblem Awakening and Fire Emblem Fates' font, Chiaro Std B Bold, to the resources folder, so it may be used in the future for text instead of the PNG.


==  Things that still need to be done  ==

- Velouria should be put in her correct place in the portrait generator, and named properly. There are two extra Kanas in the list with Japanese names, for some reason.

- See if the font can be used for the generated text instead of the PNG.




# V1.1 Changelog

- Added support for more DLC characters.

- Added support for Corrin facial features and accessories.

- Added a Background feature for conversations (the in-game Supports barrack is the default).

- Added an icon to the program.

- FEFTS now grays out the inactive character for game accuracy.

- FEFTS now enforces game-accurate text cropping (characters get cut-off if the line goes too long).

- Fixed a bug involving Velouria not showing up properly.

- Fixed a bug involving Corrin "bu" closeup portraits in the simulator (Portrait Generator was unaffected).

- Fixed a bug involving the "Previous" button functioning incorrectly.

- Further improvements to overall system stability, system security, and other minor adjustments have been made to enhance the user experience.
