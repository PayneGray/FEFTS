# FEFTS
Fire Emblem Fates Text Simulator


Forked from https://github.com/SciresM/FEITS .
Credit to SciresM for the original program. I only localized the names and fixed a few things.

Simulates Fire Emblem Fates conversations, allows for the generation of portraits with specific hair colors, and is generally neat.

== Things that still need to be done ==

- Velouria should be put in her correct place in the portrait generator, and named properly.

- There are two extra Kanas in the list with Japanese names.

- See if the font can be used for the generated text instead of the PNG.

- Add "Hidden Truths" Vallite portraits, Shigure wearing Azura's Pendant, and Ghost Azura portraits.

- Add canon hair color "Hidden Truths" children portraits.
